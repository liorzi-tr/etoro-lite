  "funds.21shares-flows.description": "<p>The <strong>\"21Shares Monthly Market Flows\"</strong> portfolio utilises a dynamic strategy based on monthly flows into European Crypto ETPs. This approach strives to capture current market sentiment and trends within the cryptocurrency space, providing investors with an opportunity to replicate the investment strategy. </p><br>\n\n<p>Each month, we perform an analysis by tracking inflows into various European Crypto ETPs (categorised by underlying asset) to identify dominant investor preferences. For instance, if Bitcoin ETPs (which track the performance of Bitcoin) experience significant inflows, the portfolio's allocation is adjusted to reflect this trend, allocating a larger portion to Bitcoin. </p>\n\n<p>This methodology ensures alignment with the dynamics of the market, allowing investors to capitalise on emerging trends and current sentiment. </p>\n\n<p> By leveraging insights from European crypto ETP flows, the <strong>“21Shares Monthly Market Flows”</strong> provides investors with a transparent and data-driven approach to cryptocurrency investment, enabling them to engage in the market's growth potential while reducing risks associated with volatility and uncertainty. </p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p> The rebalancing process involves computing the sum of flows for each ETP's underlying asset (e.g., Bitcoin ETPs), which is then proportioned against the total market flows to establish the updated weights. </p> <br>\n\n\n<p><i>Your capital is at risk.</i></p>\n<p><strong>Smart Portfolios is a portfolio management product by eToro.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to, buy or sell any financial instruments.

Then each stock undergoes a screening process based on a series of metrics, such as market capitalisation, liquidity of the shares, financial ratios and analysts' consensus ratings. The metrics form the basis for the stocks' ranking, and finally the top ranked stocks in each subsector are included in the portfolio and equally weighted.</p>\n<p><br>\n<i>The portfolio will be rebalanced annually, or at eToro’s discretion, pending market conditions.</i></p>\n<p><i>CopyPortfolio™ is a portfolio management product by eToro.<br>\nThe portfolio was created and is managed by eToro’s Investment Team.</i></p>\n<p><i>eToro is a multi-asset platform which offers both investing in stocks and crypto assets, as well as trading CFDs.</i></p>\n<p><i>CopyPortfolios™ should not be considered as exchange-traded funds, nor as hedge funds.</i></p>",

These factors help ActiveTraders to continually rank as low risk, even when markets are volatile.\n\nThe portfolio’s construction process is as follows:\n\n- Quality control: Our investor base is screened for high-quality traders by looking for significant trading activity with a medium- to long-term track record on the eToro platform and substantial capital invested across a wide range of assets, as well as a risk level appropriate to their objectives.\n\n- Advanced analysis: Then each investor’s performance is analysed, controlled by market conditions, using advanced machine learning and statistics. This process reduces the candidates down to only the best investors on the platform — those who create value beyond market exposure, with consistent strategies and risk level aligned with the portfolio’s objective.\n\n- Optimisation: In this last step, a select group of traders is filtered for the optimal and most diversified portfolios.\n\n ActiveTraders is part of eToro’s Systematic Smart Portfolio series, and is considered comparatively high risk. \n\n\n<p>This portfolio is rebalanced quarterly, or at eToro’s discretion, depending on market conditions. Each trader is weighted equally and includes a 10% stop loss.</p>\n<br>\n<p>If stop losses are triggered during any specific quarter, and subject to market conditions, the cash in balance in the portfolio may be reallocated into short-duration Treasury ETFs to earn interest. This reallocation of cash is contingent upon the duration remaining in the quarter.</p>\n\nThe minimum investment amount for this portfolio is $5,000.\n\nYour capital is at risk.\n\nThis is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to, buy or sell any financial instruments.

Then each stock undergoes a screening process based on a series of metrics, such as market capitalisation, liquidity of the shares, financial ratios and analysts' consensus ratings. The metrics form the basis for the stocks' ranking, and finally the top ranked stocks are included in the portfolio and weighted accordingly.</p>\n<p><br>\nA minimum and maximum allocation weight on the stocks in the portfolio may apply to avoid under/over allocation in the same asset.</p>\n<p><i>The portfolio will be rebalanced yearly, or at eToro’s discretion, pending market conditions.</i></p>\n<p><i>CopyPortfolio™ is a portfolio management product by eToro.<br>\nThe portfolio was created and is managed by eToro’s Investment Team.</i></p>\n<p><i>eToro is a multi-asset platform which offers both investing in stocks and crypto assets, as well as trading CFDs.</i></p>\n<p><i>CopyPortfolios™ should not be considered as exchange-traded funds, nor as hedge funds.</i></p>",

  "funds.gainersqtr.description": "The eToro platform — with its millions of users, generating billions of metrics — is the perfect environment for applying machine learning technologies.\n\nUsing advanced data science tools, eToro is able to create the next-level, data-driven investment strategy for the GainersQtr Smart Portfolio.\n\nDrawing from this unique database creates highly diversified cross-asset distribution along with a diverse geographical presence of a wide variety of traders. These factors help GainersQtr to continually rank as low risk, even when markets are volatile.\n\nThe portfolio’s construction process is as follows:\n\n- Quality control: Our investor base is screened for high-quality traders by looking for significant trading activity with a medium- to long-term track record on the eToro platform and substantial capital invested across a wide range of assets, as well as a risk level appropriate to their objectives.\n\n- Advanced analysis: Then each investor’s performance is analysed, controlled by market conditions, using advanced machine learning and statistics. This process reduces the candidates down to only the best investors on the platform — those who create value beyond market exposure, with consistent strategies and risk level aligned with the portfolio’s objective.\n\n- Optimisation: In this last step, a select group of traders is filtered for the optimal and most diversified portfolios.\n\nGainersQtr is part of eToro’s Systematic Smart Portfolio series, and is considered comparatively lower risk. \n\n<p>This portfolio is rebalanced quarterly, or at eToro’s discretion, depending on market conditions. Each trader is weighted equally and includes a 5% stop loss.</p>\n<br>\n<p>If stop losses are triggered during any specific quarter, and subject to market conditions, the cash in balance in the portfolio may be reallocated into short-duration Treasury ETFs to earn interest. This reallocation of cash is contingent upon the duration remaining in the quarter.</p>\n\nThe minimum investment amount for this portfolio is $5,000.\n\nYour capital is at risk.\n\nThis is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to, buy or sell any financial instruments.

  "funds.index-coop.description": "<p>With the cryptocurrency landscape constantly evolving, investors would be wise to adapt and diversify their holdings. Investing in a variety of assets with a mix of strategies can help to minimise risk and improve portfolio performance.\nThe Index-Coop Smart Portfolio was created in collaboration with Index Coop, an innovative decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) known for its expertise in crypto index products. By bridging traditional finance with decentralized finance (DeFi), Index Coop is making crypto investments more transparent and accessible to all.\n</p><br>\n<p>The aim of the Index-Coop Portfolio is to offer broad exposure to the largest sectors in the crypto market. While many of Index Coop’s other products are market cap-weighted, this portfolio will focus on optimising diversification. The two largest tokens, Bitcoin (30%) and Ethereum (30%), are well represented. In addition, Index Coop has identified decentralized finance  (30%) as a significant part of the crypto market, as well as the Metaverse (10%), as an important emerging theme.</p><br>\n<p>Index Coop’s DeFi Pulse Index is widely recognised as the leading benchmark for the performance of DeFi tokens on Ethereum. The index tracks applications such as decentralised exchanges, money markets, synthetic assets, and staking. The Metaverse Index captures the trend of entertainment, social, and business activity taking place in virtual economies. Each protocol falls into one of the following token categories: non-fungible tokens, entertainment, virtual reality, augmented reality, and music. Both indices choose tokens and make weightings based on circulating supply and available on-chain liquidity. Weights are calculated using a combination of square root market cap and liquidity weighting to arrive at the final index weights. Index Cooperative also evaluates projects and tokens based on their security, considering audits as well as time in the market.</p><br>\n\n<p>The portfolio will be rebalanced quarterly in accordance with the schedule of the DeFi Pulse Index and Metaverse Index maintained on the Ethereum blockchain. The latest rebalances and token inclusion criteria for the DeFi Pulse Index and Metaverse Index can be found here <a> https://indexcoop.com/products </a> </p>\n<br>\n<p>The portfolio will be rebalanced quarterly.</p>\n<p><i>Your capital is at risk.</i></p>\n<p><i>Smart Portfolios is a portfolio management product by eToro This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to, buy or sell any financial instruments.

  "funds.scalable-crypto.description": "<p>Blockchain technology is fast becoming today’s most transformative technology, gaining much attention from both the public and private sectors. In recent years, however, it has been reaching certain capacity limitations. Scalability remains a crucial challenge, as the technology encounters low-efficiency issues with low throughput, high transaction latency and high energy consumption.</p>\n<p>In the context of current blockchains, the Scalability Trilemma contends that while the ideal blockchain should be decentralised, secured and scalable, they can in reality only be two of the three. This is the most significant obstacle that blockchains must overcome before the technology can be widely used.</p><br>\n<p>The main goal of scalability is to increase transaction speed (faster finality) and transaction throughput (high transactions per second) without sacrificing decentralisation or security. Existing solutions to blockchain scalability can be classified into two categories: Layer 1 solutions propose modifications to the blockchain (i.e., changing the blockchain structure, such as block size) while Layer 2 solutions propose mechanisms that are implemented outside of the blockchain.</p>\n<p>By scaling, blockchain networks will be able to successfully compete with centralised networks for transaction throughput, application buildup and user engagement by offering higher processing capacities and greater capabilities.</p><br>\n<p>This portfolio aggregates a select group of cryptoassets, based on eToro’s asset universe, that are implementing scaling techniques and solutions to deal with these issues while preserving security and decentralisation of their platforms.</p>\n<p>The portfolio will be rebalanced yearly or at eToro’s discretion, pending market conditions.</p><br>\n<p><i>Your capital is at risk.</i></p>\n<p><i>This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to, buy or sell any financial instruments.

  "funds.tactical-edge.description": " <p><strong>eToro’s Tactical-Edge Smart Portfolio</strong> provides a strategic approach to investing, offering controlled exposure to the tech sector while aiming to minimise or eliminate capital loss risk.</p>\n\n<p>During positive market cycles, investors may hesitate to allocate new capital to recently successful themes due to fear of potential sell-offs. However, avoiding these opportunities can lead to regrets if the trend continues.</p>\n\n<p>In scenarios where loss aversion is a concern, structured allocation offers an optimal solution. By investing with reduced exposure and protecting capital partially or fully, investors can feel secure in both positive and negative market conditions.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>The Tactical-Edge Smart Portfolio strategy is open for investments until the end of June 2024, initially focusing on fixed-income ETFs comprised of short-duration government bonds. Starting in July 2024, the portfolio's capital allocation will shift as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>25% into eToro's <strong>BigTech</strong> Smart Portfolio, featuring stocks from key players in the tech market such as telecommunications, semiconductors, entertainment, e-commerce, software, and more.</li>\n\n<li>75% into fixed-income ETFs composed of investment-grade, USD-denominated corporate bonds due by the end of 2026, providing a steady income stream and enhancing investment protection.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Through the <strong>tactical</strong> allocation of one-quarter of the capital in leading tech companies across various industries and three-quarters in fixed-income instruments, this financial structure ensures a balanced, yet meaningful exposure to the tech sector, while simultaneously enhancing overall capital through regular income from corporate bonds.</p>\n\n\n<p>This strategy targets an optimal outcome by July 2026 and may be reassessed then. It may also be rebalanced at eToro’s discretion, depending on market conditions.</p><br>\n<p><i>Your capital is at risk.</i></p>\n<p><i>This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to, buy or sell any financial instruments.

  "funds.u-optimize.description": "Bio:\nThis portfolio comprises stocks listed on the S&P 500 Index that deliver the highest shareholder return on invested capital (ROIC) with solid yearly momentum. These companies have more robust fundamental characteristics than the median in the S&P 500, stronger balance sheets, less leverage, and higher EPS growth rates. It has been demonstrated in the past that these types of businesses typically outperform their industries and sectors over the long run and are less susceptible to significant drawdowns during a recession.\n\nIn addition, in times of significant stress — when the economy is heading into a recession or there is a powerful deflationary impulse, companies that fundamentally underperform the benchmark are added as short positions. The portfolio keeps the long-short balance in line with the macro model that forecasts probabilities of having a favourable or unfavourable investment climate.\n\nThe product is suitable for investors with a 1–2 year investment horizon with medium-risk tolerance and a focus on US companies.\n\nMethodology\nEvery year, the U-Optimize Team outlines two compositions: one of companies to buy and the second of companies to sell. Both compositions are built based on the S&P 500 Index and are ranked using the proprietary algorithm. After the 1st phase of screening, 50–60 companies are classified as potential “buy” candidates, and 150 companies are classified as potential “sell” candidates. Only 40–45 companies get into the portfolio after the final stage of the selection process.\n\nThe model is updated annually towards the beginning of April. The “buy” and “sell” compositions do not change for a year following the update. The average portfolio turnover is set within the 80–100% range. The primary rebalancing period starts in April and ends in May. Both long and short candidates are equally weighted in the portfolio. After the mean-variance portfolio optimisation process, a slight weight adjustment can be made to each company. Only under extreme circumstances,  or if the long-short balance shifts towards a defensive stance, is a company removed from the portfolio. The maximum allocated weight to the short portion of the portfolio is set at 30–50%.\n\nThe portfolio has only two primary phases — long-only (aggressive) and long-short (defensive). The macro model commands the shift between these two. The only active management is in the form of slight modification to balance exposure. In general, the strategy has a more passive approach.",

Ultimately, the technology can be used to enhance transparency and security across a range of industries by allowing the creation of decentralised applications, or dApps. dApps are open-source, autonomous, and operate through smart contracts – self-executing codes that run on the blockchain.</p><br>\n<p>Web3 applications can provide solutions to problems that exist for many industries, such as high transaction fees, slow payment processing, centralisation, and lack of transparency.</p><br>\n<p>This portfolio is equally weighted and aggregates two groups. The first group consists of crypto tokens which power dApps offering services outside the financial sector. These dApps have already disrupted traditional industries – including file storage, IoT, gaming, content creation, browsers, shared computing, artificial intelligence, identity and data management – and are expected to continue doing so in the coming years.</p><br>\n<p>The second group includes stocks of companies that have partnered with one or more dApps to develop a Web3 strategy and implement it into their current business model. These companies are at the forefront of digital transformation, and are leveraging the power of blockchain technology to create new business models, streamline operations, and enhance customer experience.</p><br>\n<p><i>The portfolio will be rebalanced yearly, or at eToro’s discretion, pending market conditions.</i></p>\n<p><i>Your capital is at risk.</i></p>\n<p><i>This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to, buy or sell any financial instruments.

  "funds.yieldgrowth.description": "<p>Over the past decade, low interest rates drove investors away from fixed-income assets such as bonds. They sought higher yields elsewhere in the markets instead.</p>\n<p>But, recently, the post-COVID-19 macroeconomic environment has pushed central banks worldwide to dramatically raise interest rates in order to fight inflation. These higher rates are making fixed income attractive once again to investors.</p><br>\n<p>Fixed-income investments carry lower risk than other assets such as stocks — this is because they are generally less sensitive to macroeconomic risks, which offset potential drawdowns in volatile markets. They may be particularly suitable for investors looking to focus on capital preservation and regular income.</p><br>\n<p>This portfolio provides potential investors with exposure to a highly diversified allocation of fixed-income assets, while seeking to create an optimal balance between risk, yield and duration as interest rates shift.</p>\n<p>The portfolio risk is managed through diversification of varying credit ratings, durations, and issuers. The balance of risk and return ensures that the portfolio generates income while minimising potential capital losses.</p>\n<p>To achieve diversification, this portfolio allocates across different strategies of fixed-income ETFs/UCITS, such as government and corporate bonds, inflation-protected, bullet and floating rate instruments, investment-grade and high-yield risks, and short- and medium-term durations. This diversification helps to reduce concentration risk and mitigate the impact of adverse events in any particular sector or issuer.</p>\n<p>The process of selecting the fixed-income ETFs considers their expense ratios, average duration, indicative yield, rating class, total assets and target strategy.</p><br>\n<p>The portfolio will be rebalanced quarterly or at eToro’s discretion, pending market conditions.</p><br>\n<p><i>Your capital is at risk.</i></p>\n<p><i>This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to, buy or sell any financial instruments.

Migrating your account to eToro UK enables you to invest in real cryptoassets and securities (in addition to trading in CFDs).

Furthermore, you will also now be able to benefit from our staking offering with respect to certain cryptoassets by participating in our reward program.<br><br>Additionally, as a client of eToro UK you now benefit from the enhanced protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) - the UK's compensation fund, which covers clients up to an equivalent of £85,000 per client - in relation to regulated transactions (specifically, securities and CFDs). Please note that cryptoassets are unregulated, and therefore are excluded from the protection applicable to regulated investment services.<br><br>We may convert your existing cryptoasset CFD positions into real/physical cryptoassets. We may also convert any non-leveraged stock CFD positions to real securities positions. You will continue to have the same economic exposure to the cryptoassets/stocks that you had under the original CFD positions (same number of cryptoasset/stock units and the open price), however. The new real cryptoassets/stocks bought on your behalf will be held in a custody account according to our terms. Please note that the migration of positions may constitute a tax event on your part. Please consult your tax advisor.<br><br>If you fund your account by wire transfer, please make sure to check the updated Bank account details (see Payment Method).

  "stocksLendingGapInfo.content": "<b>Definitions of terms within the opt-in process</b><br>eToro (UK) Ltd. (“eToro UK”) appoints eToro Europe Limited (“eToro EU”) as its custodian who therefore facilitates share lending. eToro EU appoints a 3rd-party global custodian which (with respect to share lending) acts as the Lending Agent. “Lending Agent” refers to the 3rd-party lending agent. “eToro” refers to eToro UK and eToro EU collectively (unless expressly stated otherwise).<br><br><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><br><b>Features of Share Lending</b><br>Start lending shares in your eToro Investment Account. Earn extra income on your portfolio by allowing eToro to lend your shares secured with collateral, without losing your freedom to trade them. Stock lending is not without risk.<br><br><b>How it works</b><br>Subject to your explicit consent, eToro will borrow shares from you and will then facilitate the lending to third party market participants (the “Borrowers”) who are willing to pay a fee on the value of the shares.<br><br>In exchange for the lent shares, the Lending Agent will receive collateral from the Borrower for an amount greater than that of the lent shares value. Such collateral will be held on your behalf in segregated accounts according to the applicable client assets rules and monitored on an ongoing basis during the time period that the shares are lent.<br>By enrolling in a share lending program, you grant us the legal right to use shares in your portfolio to enter into share lending transactions at our discretion.<br><br><b>The status of your shares when they are not lent</b><br>Until such time that eToro lends your shares and exercises the legal right to use, those shares will continue to be treated in the same manner as they are today i.e., as client assets in accordance with our standard terms and conditions.<br><br>Enrolling in share lending does not mean that your shares will be lent.<br><br><b>Earn income</b><br>Each day your shares are lent, eToro will receive income on those shares and will pass 50% of that income to you. Note that income from share lending may be subject to tax and you should seek independent advice if required.<br><br><b>No restrictions to your trading</b><br>You remain free to sell your shares at any point. If you do sell some or all of a share position that is being lent, there are processes and controls in place to recall your shares from the Borrower in time to ensure your sale settles in the normal timeframe. These controls include eToro monitoring sales activity throughout the day.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br>There could be instances where settlement of your sale is delayed beyond the normal settlement cycle – this may result in you not being able to withdraw those sale proceeds from your account until settlement.<br><br><b>COLLATERAL</b><br><br><b>Your loans are secured with collateral</b><br>Your lent shares are secured with collateral received from the Borrower. Until such time as the share lending transaction(s) are complete, the collateral is held on your behalf and is treated as safe custody assets according to the applicable client assets rules.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br>Share lending transactions are not settled through a central securities depository to facilitate simultaneous exchange of loaned shares and collateral. Therefore, there could be a gap between the transfer of your lent shares to a Borrower and receipt of the collateral. To manage this risk, we have agreed controls which include ensuring receipt of collateral before or at the same time loaned shares are transferred to a Borrower.<br><br>The value of both the lent shares and the collateral held will move continuously, as a result of movements in market prices. We therefore revalue the lent shares and collateral on a daily basis to ensure any value changes are reflected in the total collateral we hold for open loans.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br>A drop in the value of collateral and/or an increase in the value of loaned shares (because of market movements and new loans) since the last collateral adjustment may result in a collateral amount insufficient to cover your loaned position/s. We manage this risk by requiring the revaluing of the lent shares and collateral daily and by requiring the Borrowers to provide collateral to a minimum of 102% of the market value of the shares lent.<br>\n     Rarely, situations may arise where – after we have executed an instruction from you to (for example) sell a security or to leave the Share Lending program - a borrower or the lending agent may subsequently fail to return all or some of the securities. If this happens, we may recover any shortfall in value from you. This could include deducting money from your eToro account, closing open positions, selling your assets if your balance is not sufficient, or adjusting the position of your securities.<br><br>\n     <b>How your collateral is held</b><br>Until such time as the share lending transaction(s) are complete, the collateral will be designated as safe custody assets according to the applicable client assets rules and be held by the Lending Agent as custodian in a segregated account on your behalf, together with collateral held on behalf of other eToro customers whose securities are also being lent. In the unlikely event that the Borrower defaults on their obligation to return the securities, eToro – with the assistance of the Lending Agent - will take all reasonable measures to return equivalent securities or cash back to you. In the event of eToro's insolvency, the collateral will be protected for the benefit of clients according to the applicable client assets rules.<br>In the unlikely event that the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover the lent securities, you may receive fewer Equivalent Securities. We will use our best efforts to ensure sufficient collateral is returned to repurchase Equivalent Securities on your behalf. If we are unable to purchase Equivalent Securities, we will close your position and pay you cash equivalent to the value of your lent securities, less any relevant costs. If the collateral value is still insufficient, your return will be less than the value of your lent securities, and eToro will not cover the shortfall.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br>Share lending transactions indirectly expose you to counterparty credit risk. This is a risk when a counterparty - in this case, the Lending Agent or a Borrower of your shares - does not fulfil their obligation to return your shares. For example, this could arise because the Lending Agent or the Borrower becomes insolvent.<br><br>In the event of the Lending Agent or a Borrower's default, the collateral received from the Lending Agent and in turn the Borrower will be liquidated to return the value of the loaned shares to you, in cash. The value of collateral received from the Lending Agent and in turn the Borrower should be greater than the value of your lent shares, but in a scenario where this is not the case (e.g., the collateral losing value and/or the value of lent shares increasing since the last collateral adjustment), the payment you receive may be less than the loaned shares value.<br><br>This risk is further mitigated by entering into additional protections with the Lending Agent who indemnifies us for any difference between the liquidated collateral value and the value of your lent shares in the event of a Borrower’s default.<br><br><b>Type of collateral</b><br>The collateral accepted from Borrowers, will be in the form of high-quality liquid assets, which are designed to be liquidated easily and immediately into cash, with minimal or no loss of value, such as government bonds.<br><br><b>DIVIDENDS AND CORPORATE ACTIONS</b><br><br><b>Voting rights go to the Borrower</b><br>The Borrower becomes the legal owner of the shares while they are on loan. This means that you will temporarily lose ownership of those shares and any associated rights (i.e. voting\n     rights).<br><br><b>Dividends</b><br>Dividends that may be paid to the Borrower while the underlying shares are on loan should be repaid to eToro by the Lending Agent. You will receive from eToro the same dividend amount as paid by the Lending Agent as a payment in lieu. In some instances, there could be a delay in you receiving this payment and it will only be paid following receipt of this payment by eToro. You are obligated to pay any tax imposed on dividend payments.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br>In some jurisdictions, payments in lieu are taxed differently than dividend payments. You should seek independent tax advice if required.<br><br><b>OTHER FEATURES</b><br><br><b>Fully automatic</b><br>Once enrolled, you will not need to do anything. Share lending is fully automatic and happens in the background<br><br><b>Complete transparency</b><br>We will not notify you every time we lend out any of your shares. Information setting out which of the shares in your portfolio have been lent out, and how much income you have earned in the period will be available via a monthly statement.<br><br>The statement will also show you information on the current position regarding shares on loan and the value of collateral held to secure your loan.<br><br><b>No commitment</b><br>You can opt-out of share lending by canceling at any time.

  "stocksLendingGapInfo.contentEU": "<b>Definitions of terms within the opt-in process</b><br>eToro EU appoints a 3rd-party global custodian which (with respect to share lending) acts as the Lending Agent. “Lending Agent” refers to the 3rd-party lending agent. <br><br><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><br><b>Features of Share Lending</b><br>Start lending shares in your eToro Investment Account. Earn extra income on your portfolio by allowing eToro to lend your shares secured with collateral, without losing your freedom to trade them. Stock lending is not without risk.<br><br><b>How it works</b><br>Subject to your explicit consent, eToro will borrow shares from you and will then facilitate the lending to third party market participants (the “Borrowers”) who are willing to pay a fee on the value of the shares.<br><br>In exchange for the lent shares, the Lending Agent will receive collateral from the Borrower for an amount greater than that of the lent shares value. Such collateral will be held on your behalf in segregated accounts according to the applicable client assets rules and monitored on an ongoing basis during the time period that the shares are lent.<br>By enrolling in a share lending program, you grant us the legal right to use shares in your portfolio to enter into share lending transactions at our discretion.<br><br><b>The status of your shares when they are not lent</b><br>Until such time that eToro lends your shares and exercises the legal right to use, those shares will continue to be treated in the same manner as they are today i.e., as client assets in accordance with our standard terms and conditions.<br><br>Enrolling in share lending does not mean that your shares will be lent.<br><br><b>Earn income</b><br>Each day your shares are lent, eToro will receive income on those shares and will pass 50% of that income to you. Note that income from share lending may be subject to tax and you should seek independent advice if required.<br><br><b>No restrictions to your trading</b><br>You remain free to sell your shares at any point. If you do sell some or all of a share position that is being lent, there are processes and controls in place to recall your shares from the Borrower in time to ensure your sale settles in the normal timeframe. These controls include eToro monitoring sales activity throughout the day.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br>There could be instances where settlement of your sale is delayed beyond the normal settlement cycle – this may result in you not being able to withdraw those sale proceeds from your account until settlement.<br><br><b>COLLATERAL</b><br><br><b>Your loans are secured with collateral</b><br>Your lent shares are secured with collateral received from the Borrower. Until such time as the share lending transaction(s) are complete, the collateral is held on your behalf and is treated as safe custody assets according to the applicable client assets rules.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br>Share lending transactions are not settled through a central securities depository to facilitate simultaneous exchange of loaned shares and collateral. Therefore, there could be a gap between the transfer of your lent shares to a Borrower and receipt of the collateral. To manage this risk, we have agreed controls which include ensuring receipt of collateral before or at the same time loaned shares are transferred to a Borrower.<br><br>The value of both the lent shares and the collateral held will move continuously, as a result of movements in market prices. We therefore revalue the lent shares and collateral on a daily basis to ensure any value changes are reflected in the total collateral we hold for open loans.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br>A drop in the value of collateral and/or an increase in the value of loaned shares (because of market movements and new loans) since the last collateral adjustment may result in a collateral amount insufficient to cover your loaned position/s. We manage this risk by requiring the revaluing of the lent shares and collateral daily and by requiring the Borrowers to provide collateral to a minimum of 102% of the market value of the shares lent.<br>\n     Rarely, situations may arise where – after we have executed an instruction from you to (for example) sell a security or to leave the Share Lending program - a borrower or the lending agent may subsequently fail to return all or some of the securities. If this happens, we may recover any shortfall in value from you. This could include deducting money from your eToro account, closing open positions, selling your assets if your balance is not sufficient, or adjusting the position of your securities.<br><br>\n     <b>How your collateral is held</b><br>Until such time as the share lending transaction(s) are complete, the collateral will be designated as safe custody assets according to the applicable client assets rules and be held by the Lending Agent as custodian in a segregated account on your behalf, together with collateral held on behalf of other eToro customers whose securities are also being lent. In the unlikely event that the Borrower defaults on their obligation to return the securities, eToro – with the assistance of the Lending Agent - will take all reasonable measures to return equivalent securities or cash back to you. In the event of eToro's insolvency, the collateral will be protected for the benefit of clients according to the applicable client assets rules.<br>In the unlikely event that the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover the lent securities, you may receive fewer Equivalent Securities. We will use our best efforts to ensure sufficient collateral is returned to repurchase Equivalent Securities on your behalf. If we are unable to purchase Equivalent Securities, we will close your position and pay you cash equivalent to the value of your lent securities, less any relevant costs. If the collateral value is still insufficient, your return will be less than the value of your lent securities, and eToro will not cover the shortfall.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br>Share lending transactions indirectly expose you to counterparty credit risk. This is a risk when a counterparty - in this case, the Lending Agent or a Borrower of your shares - does not fulfil their obligation to return your shares. For example, this could arise because the Lending Agent or the Borrower becomes insolvent.<br><br>In the event of the Lending Agent or a Borrower's default, the collateral received from the Lending Agent and in turn the Borrower will be liquidated to return the value of the loaned shares to you, in cash. The value of collateral received from the Lending Agent and in turn the Borrower should be greater than the value of your lent shares, but in a scenario where this is not the case (e.g., the collateral losing value and/or the value of lent shares increasing since the last collateral adjustment), the payment you receive may be less than the loaned shares value.<br><br>This risk is further mitigated by entering into additional protections with the Lending Agent who indemnifies us for any difference between the liquidated collateral value and the value of your lent shares in the event of a Borrower’s default.<br><br><b>Type of collateral</b><br>The collateral accepted from Borrowers, will be in the form of high-quality liquid assets, which are designed to be liquidated easily and immediately into cash, with minimal or no loss of value, such as government bonds.<br><br><b>DIVIDENDS AND CORPORATE ACTIONS</b><br><br><b>Voting rights go to the Borrower</b><br>The Borrower becomes the legal owner of the shares while they are on loan. This means that you will temporarily lose ownership of those shares and any associated rights (i.e. voting\n     rights).<br><br><b>Dividends</b><br>Dividends that may be paid to the Borrower while the underlying shares are on loan should be repaid to eToro by the Lending Agent. You will receive from eToro the same dividend amount as paid by the Lending Agent as a payment in lieu. In some instances, there could be a delay in you receiving this payment and it will only be paid following receipt of this payment by eToro. You are obligated to pay any tax imposed on dividend payments.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br>In some jurisdictions, payments in lieu are taxed differently than dividend payments. You should seek independent tax advice if required.<br><br><b>OTHER FEATURES</b><br><br><b>Fully automatic</b><br>Once enrolled, you will not need to do anything. Share lending is fully automatic and happens in the background<br><br><b>Complete transparency</b><br>We will not notify you every time we lend out any of your shares. Information setting out which of the shares in your portfolio have been lent out, and how much income you have earned in the period will be available via a monthly statement.<br><br>The statement will also show you information on the current position regarding shares on loan and the value of collateral held to secure your loan.<br><br><b>No commitment</b><br>You can opt-out of share lending by canceling at any time. Note that processing of an instruction to opt-out could take up to 5 business days<br><br><b>Risk</b><br>Lent out shares are typically used for shorting. Market participants often borrow shares to sell them short, possibly affecting the value of those shares.<br><br><b>CONFIRMATION</b><br><br>I provide my express consent and grant eToro a right to use which allows eToro to offer the shares in my eToro Investment account for lending as follows:<br><br><ul><li>eToro may borrow my shares and lend them to other market participants.</li><li>eToro will secure the lent shares with collateral (at least 102% of the value of the lent shares).

Due to certain changes in our cryptoassets CFDs offering in eToro Australia we would like to provide you with the option to become a customer of eToro UK Limited (“eToro UK”), our FCA regulated company. Migrating your account to eToro UK will enable you to invest in real cryptoassets and securities in addition to trading CFDs (except for cryptoassets which can only be traded as underlying assets).

If you do not close these open positions yourself, we have the right to close all such open positions that you have not closed at this time.<br><br>As part of the migration process, we will convert your existing cryptoassets positions and non-leveraged securities CFD into their underlying asset. You will continue to have the same economic exposure to the cryptoassets/stocks that you had under the original CFD positions (the same number of cryptoassets/stocks units and open price). The new underlying cryptoassets/stocks bought will be held by us on your behalf. Conversion of positions may constitute a tax event on your part.

Instead, a new product, <b>Non-Deliverable Cryptoassets (“NDC”), will become available to you.</b><br><br>Although we offer the NDC trading service, the eToro investment platform is not an exchange or a market. This means that you can only enter into NDC trades with us on the platform, and not with third parties. eToro will hold NDCs on your behalf. You will also not generally have the right to vote, stake, or otherwise participate in any events or actions that may occur in relation to the NDC. Therefore, our services are limited to you buying and selling the NDC on our platform.<br><br>In addition, you will generally not be able to transfer your NDCs out of your eToro account, including for the purposes of selling that NDC on another platform or to another person, or transfer NDCs into the eToro wallet or into your eToro account from a different account.<br><br>As cryptoassets are unregulated, when you use our NDC trading service, you will not benefit from the protections available to clients receiving regulated investment services such as CFD cryptoassets. For example, you will not be able to make complaints to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or the Australian Financial Compensation Authority. Also, money you provide to us in relation to NDC trading will not need to be held by us as client money held in a client money account, and you will therefore be subject to eToro counterparty risk.<br><br>For your convenience, you will find eToro AUS Capital Limited and eToro Service’s customer documentation linked below: <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{financialProductTermsUrl}}\">Financial Product Terms</a> (is defined as relating to the eToro NDC offering), <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{productDisclosureStatementUrl}}\">Product Disclosure Statement</a>, <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{financialServicesGuideUrl}}\">Financial Services Guide</a>, <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{privacyPolicyUrl}}\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"{{cookiePolicyUrl}}\">Cookie Policy</a>.",
